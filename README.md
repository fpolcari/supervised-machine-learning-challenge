# supervised-machine-learning-challenge

This challenge required the following:

We needed to create and compare two models on this data: a Logistic Regression, and a Random Forests Classifier. 
Before creating, fitting, and scoring the models, we were asked to make a prediction as to which model we think will perform better. We wrote down our prediction (in markdown cells in our Jupyter Notebook, and provided a justification for the educated guess.

Specifically we were tasked with the following:
Create a Logistic Regression model
fit it to the data
print the model's score. 
Then do the same for a Random Forest Classifier. 

Finally we were tasked with answering the following questions:
Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts.

In my supervised machine learning challenge the random forest classifier model actually performed better than the logistic regression model; which was opposite from my prediction.
My Logistic Rregression Model results showed 0.9938093272802311 while my Random Forest Classifier Model showed 0.9969046636401155. In summary, I think that the Random Forest classification model ended up being the best technique because its highly efficient. It can handle binary, continuous, and categorical data and even though it's a bit slower than the logistic regression model overall it is still fast and efficient and can handle missing values and overall it's flexible with some limitations.
